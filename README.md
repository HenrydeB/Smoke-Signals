## General Info

This application is in it's very early stages. This application was created with a combination of the Google Maps API for REACT and the NASA Eath Observatory Natural Event Tracker. This was created with the intention of expanding this project in the future (more on this later) and could, with a combination of various technologies, could serve as an early warning system for areas that are affected. With NASA's live data continuously updating and other data such as LIDAR and other information that can be gathered by Geographic Information Systems (GIS), there is the potential for this program to have a gauge on the risks of a large fire in certain areas (again, provided there is enough data)

## Preview

Currently, this application looks like this

The fire icons represent different wildfires currently active around the world, as NASA's satellites actively gather data every day.

## Future Expansion

As stated in the General Info section, this application is in the very early stages of it's development (as it stands on 04/01/2021 it isn't even online). There is a lot that has to be done for it to reach it's full intended functionality, however the basic idea is there. Eventually this will be expanded to be a full website that has information detailing what can cause and exacerbate wildfires, along with ways that we can do what we can to prevent them in the future (proper forestry care, etc. etc). This application can also be expanded to
