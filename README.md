# Smoke-Signals
This is an application that uses the Google Maps Javascript API and the NASA Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker API.
This project will be expanded to include the tracking of storms and other disasters that may impact local populations. The ideal expansion
will include a connection to GIS databases where we can identify conditions that may exacerbate said disasters such as dry climate conditions,
poor forestry management (underbrush, etc) and similar factors, and use machine learning hopefully have an early warning system in place for the people in that area that is accessible to everyone.
